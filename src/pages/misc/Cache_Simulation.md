description: "This project involves the implementation and testing of various cache replacement strategies, including Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO). The simulation was conducted on large datasets to evaluate the efficiency and performance of each strategy in managing memory and reducing cache misses. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different cache management techniques for optimizing computational tasks."
